# MatterhornNative
The native matterhorn app, coming to a store near you!

Still very much a work in-progress, but react native is awesome!

## TO DO
- Add dropdown menu with context (Create project, create ticket / feature, add comment)
- View Ticket
- Leave comments
- AsyncDown for storing local information.


## Offline access
Being without an internet connection is a pain. I want to be able to start discussions locally and then sync them when a connection comes back.

More to come..
